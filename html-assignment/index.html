        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Xiaoyu Cui from China. I used to work in the investment field for a biopharmaceutical company in China. In my previous role, storytelling through PowerPoint presentations was a crucial aspect of my investment work. At that time, aesthetically pleasing design became my pursuit. However, as time passed, I wanted to explore a broader design field. That's why I chose the IMD program.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, I obtained a master's degree in business in the United States. Living in North America was my aspiration, and I love the cultural environment hereâ€”simple, with a certain distance yet full of care. I'm thrilled to be taking Professor Rob's course at Algonquin College. This is not flattery but a sincere expression. Being fortunate to have a professor who is passionate about teaching a significant course is a lucky start. I hope to gain more valuable knowledge in the journey ahead.</p>
